# AUTHOR / SPEAKER QUICK-SYNC – PROJECT OVERVIEW

*(Sync the **author-speaker** Airtable table with the **author-speaker** WordPress taxonomy)*

> This document plugs straight into the Quick-Sync MASTER BLUEPRINT and the WP-Plugin Blueprint we fleshed out earlier.
> 
> 
> Wherever the master docs say “post” or “CPT”, read **“taxonomy term”** for this project.
>

## 1 · What we’re building

| Source | Target | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Airtable table** `author-speaker` | **WordPress taxonomy** `author-speaker` | Keep author names, slugs, bios, profile images, and a unique SKU perfectly mirrored so every post, series, or session can reference the same canonical Author term. |

The approach is identical to Series / Events Quick-Sync – but the WP endpoint manipulates **terms** instead of **posts**.

---

## 2 · High-Level Workflow (same bones)

1. **Button click** in Airtable → `sync_status = "Queued"`.
2. **AuthorMediaScript.js** uploads / syncs the profile image.
3. **AuthorsQuickSyncScript.js** builds a payload and hits `/author-sync`.
4. WP plugin **AuthorsQuickSyncWP.php** creates/updates the taxonomy term and its meta.
5. Success branch stamps `wp_id`, `sync_status = "Done"`, `publish_timestamp`.

*(See the Mermaid ladder in the MASTER BLUEPRINT for a pictorial view – it’s 100 % the same.)*

## 3 · Field-Mapping Cheat-Sheet

| Airtable Field | WP Payload Key | Stored As | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `author_title` | `name` | Term name | Required. |
| `author_slug` | `slug` | Term slug | Should stay unique. |
| `author_description` | `as_description` | Term description | Uses description column visible in WP Admin. |
| `profile_image_wp_id` | `profile_image` | Term meta (ID) | Image ID from MediaScript. |
| `sku` | `sku` | Term meta (`sku`) & **top-level** payload key | Primary unique key for de-duplication. |

No `post_status`, `post_date`, or custom permalinks – they don’t exist for taxonomy terms.

---

## 4 · AuthorMediaScript.js – what’s special?

- **Table name** hard-coded to `author-speaker`.
- Only one image set (`profile_image_*`).
- Uses the same “skip if `media_last_modified` ≤ `media_publish_timestamp`” gate as series.
- Writes three fields per image: **ID**, **URL**, **external cache** – ensures idempotent re-runs.
- On any change it bumps `media_publish_timestamp` so Quick-Sync knows the media is fresh.

---

## 5 · AuthorsQuickSyncScript.js – key points

- **Route suffix**: `/wp-json/four12/v1/author-sync`
- **FIELD_MAP** keeps the transformation declarative; nothing is hand-coded.
- Promotes `sku` to the payload top level so the WP plugin can find the term fast.
- Minimal core keys: **name** & **slug** – that’s all a term really has.
- Verbose logging pipes a truncated payload preview to the Airtable step output for eyeballing.

---

## 6 · WP Plugin (AuthorsQuickSyncWP.php) – what changes vs the CPT version?

| CPT Plugin Logic | Author-Sync Variant |
| --- | --- |
| **`wp_insert_post()`** / `wp_update_post()` | **`wp_insert_term()`** / `wp_update_term()` |
| Core field map: `post_title`, `post_status`, … | Core term map: `name`, `slug`, `description` |
| Uses **post-meta** (`update_post_meta`) | Uses **term-meta** (`update_term_meta`) |
| Featured image = `_thumbnail_id` | Profile image = `profile_image` (meta) |
| Permalink Manager hook (for posts) | **Not needed** – term URLs are auto-generated by WP. |
| AIOSEO block for posts | *Optional* – AIOSEO allows term meta too; include or remove. |
| SKUs stored via `add_post_meta` | SKUs stored via `update_term_meta` (`sku`) |

Everything else (auth guard, logging wrapper, image sideload helper, diff tracker) is literally copy-pasted from the CPT plugin – evidence that the Blueprint pattern holds.

---

## 7 · Why the term logic works (under the hood)

1. **De-duplication**:
    
    *Fast path* – if the payload carries `wp_id`, we hit `wp_update_term()` directly.
    
    *Fallback* – search `author-speaker` taxonomy for `meta_key = 'sku'` & matching value, then update; else insert.
    
2. **Slug safety**:
    
    `*wp_update_term()*` silently fixes duplicate slugs by appending “-2”. The plugin checks for this and logs a warning so editors can rectify duplicates in Airtable.
    
3. **Image meta**:
    
    WordPress core has no official “featured image” for terms. JetEngine (and ACF) expose term-meta. Storing the **attachment ID** in `profile_image` gives uniform access in theme templates.
    
4. **Description vs Custom Fields**:
    
    The term’s “Description” box in WP Admin stores HTML; our payload key `as_description` fills that, making the bio visible in any taxonomy archive.

## 8 · Automation Inputs / Secrets

| Input | Example | Where used |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `recordId` | `recabcdef123` | Both scripts |
| `apiBaseUrl` | `https://four12global.com` (no trailing slash) | QuickSyncScript only |
| **Secret** `API-SYNC` | `wpuser:abcd1234APPLICATIONPASS` | Headers for both scripts |

---

## 9 · Replicating for *another* term-based taxonomy

1. **Duplicate** AuthorMediaScript.js & AuthorsQuickSyncScript.js.
2. Change:
    - `TABLE_NAME`, `WP_ROUTE_SUFFIX`, `AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME`
    - `IMAGE_FIELDS` array (if your new taxonomy needs multiple images).
    - The `FIELD_MAP` – at minimum map **name**, **slug**, **description**.
3. Duplicate the WP plugin file, tweak constants:
    
    ```php
    const F12_SYNC_TAXONOMY = 'my-new-tax';
    const F12_TAXONOMY_ROUTE = '/my-tax-sync';
    
    ```
    
    Keep the helper functions untouched.
    
4. Update Airtable automation (button label, view filters, status fields).
5. Test with one record → check WP term appears with correct slug & image.
6. Remove `console.log` spam / set VERBOSE = false once happy.

## 10 · Common Pitfalls & Pro Tips

| Gotcha | Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Duplicate slugs** | WP appends “-2” | Make slug field read-only & derive from title in Airtable. |
| **Image shows as blank** | Attachment ID saved but media missing | MediaScript ran against staging while Quick-Sync hit prod. Keep both endpoints in sync. |
| **Term not found by SKU** | New term inserted every click | Someone edited SKU in Airtable; freeze the field once published. |
| **Taxonomy not registered** | 404 on `/wp-json/four12/v1/author-sync` | Register `author-speaker` taxonomy in theme/plugin *before* the Quick-Sync plugin loads. |

### TL;DR

*Same Quick-Sync skeleton, different target entity.*

Switch posts → terms, adjust three constants, and the Author pipeline hums exactly like Series. Follow this document plus the MASTER BLUEPRINT and you’ll never wrestle with orphaned bios or mismatched profile photos again. 🎤

How “Parsedown + Quick-Sync” fits into the Author pipeline

(Markdown in Airtable → safe-ish HTML in WordPress, no tears.)

⸻

1 · Why we use Parsedown here
	•	Airtable convenience – editors can write bios with *italics*, **bold**, > quotes, etc.
	•	WordPress taxonomy fields only accept HTML, not Markdown.
	•	Parsedown gives a zero-config, single-file bridge: you drop vendor/Parsedown.php in the plugin folder, call Parsedown::instance()->text( $markdown ), and out pops HTML ready for the term Description (or a custom meta key if you prefer).

⸻

2 · Where the code lives

author-sync/
├── author-media-script.js
├── authors-quick-sync.php
└── vendor/
    └── Parsedown.php   ← this guy

We keep it inside the plugin (not composer-installed) so production servers with no SSH/composer still work.

⸻

3 · What actually happens in AuthorsQuickSyncWP.php
	1.	Payload key – Airtable sends author_bio_md (Markdown) and author_description (plain text).
	2.	Plugin step (just before generic meta save):

if ( isset( $payload['author_bio_md'] ) ) {
    $md  = $payload['author_bio_md'];
    unset( $payload['author_bio_md'] );

    // 1. Parse              2. Very quick sanitise
    $html = wp_kses_post( Parsedown::instance()->text( $md ) );

    // 3. Save to term description
    wp_update_term( $term_id, F12_SYNC_TAXONOMY, [ 'description' => $html ] );
    f12_sync_log( "Parsedown: bio converted & saved for term {$term_id}" );
    $changed_summary['core'][] = 'description (Parsedown)';
}


	3.	Why wp_kses_post after Parsedown?
Parsedown happily converts [script>alert(1) into <script> tags. A quick wp_kses_post() strip-safes that output without needing a full Purifier.
	4.	Diff tracking – we flag “description (Parsedown)” so Airtable sees that content changed.

⸻

4 · How to replicate in another Quick-Sync plugin

Step	What to do
1	Copy vendor/Parsedown.php into your new plugin folder.
2	require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/Parsedown.php'; near the top of the plugin file (after the constant declarations).
3	Pick a payload key (e.g. event_notes_md). In the main handler, run the 3-line block above, saving to either post_content, description, or a custom meta.
4	Sanitize with wp_kses_post() unless you 100 % trust your editors.
5	unset() the Markdown key so it doesn’t fall into the generic meta loop.


⸻

5 · Common pitfalls & pro tips

Gotcha	Symptom	Fix
Parsedown class not found	Fatal error	Wrong path in require_once; remember __DIR__ is plugin root.
Markdown saved as raw text	Bio in WP shows **bold**	You forgot to run the Parsedown block or you saved the wrong field.
Sneaky <script> survives	XSS alert	You skipped wp_kses_post() (or another sanitiser).
Double conversion on re-sync	Bold text turns into <p><strong>… nestled twice	Make sure you only convert if Markdown key is present; don’t reconvert stored HTML.


⸻

6 · Why not use JetEngine WYSIWYG or Gutenberg blocks instead?
	•	Simplicity – Parsedown is one file, no JSON overhead, perfect for “fire-and-forget” term descriptions.
	•	Consistency – The same Markdown content can be rendered in mobile apps, emails, or static sites without pulling HTML out of WP.
	•	Editorial friendliness – Most writers know *italic* faster than <em>.

⸻

7 · TL;DR

Drop Markdown in Airtable → Parsedown in the plugin converts → wp_kses_post() scrubs → WordPress term description looks gorgeous.
Add those five integration lines to any new Quick-Sync plugin and your content team can keep writing in Markdown glory.
